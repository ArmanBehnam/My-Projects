# Clustering-Geolocation-Data-Intelligently-in-Python
Clustering Geolocation Data Intelligently in Python


Course Objectives
In this course, I am going to focus on three learning objectives:

- How to visualize and understand geographical data in an interactive way with Python.
- How the K-Means algorithm works, and some of the shortcomings it has.
- Density-based clustering approaches, and how to deal with any outliers they may classify.


By the end of this course, I was able to take raw geographical data, and cluster it effectively using basic or more advanced density-based clustering techniques -- I also learnt about how to determine the strength of a given clustering and how to plot this data in an interactive way within Python that can be exported easily.



Project Structure
The project on Clustering Geolocation Data is divided into following tasks:

- Task 1: An introduction to the problem, as well as basic exploratory data analysis and visualizations
- Task 2: Visualizing geographical data in a more meaningful and interactive way
- Task 3: Methods of evaluating the strength of a clustering algorithm
- Task 4: Theory behind K-Means, and how to use it for our problem
- Task 5: Introduction to density-based clustering approaches, and how to use DBSCAN
- Task 6: Introduction to HDBSCAN, to alleviate constraints of classical DBSCAN
- Task 7: A simple method to address outliers classified by density-based models
