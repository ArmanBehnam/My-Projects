## Project Description
Using the statistical data visualization library, Seaborn, to discover and explore the relationships in the Wisconsin breast cancer data set (diagnosis). Producing visualizations is an important first step in exploring and analyzing real-world data sets. As such, visualization is an indispensable method in any data scientist's toolbox. It is also a powerful tool to identify problems in analyses and for illustrating results.

**The project was carried out according to the following steps:**

- Task 1: Introduction and Importing the Data,
- Task 2: Separate Target from Features,
- Task 3: Diagnosis Distribution Visualization,
- Task 4: Visualizing Standardized Data with Seaborn,
- Task 5 : Violin Plots and Box Plots,
- Task 6: Using Joint Plots for Feature Comparison,
- Task 7: Observing the Distribution of Values and their Variance with Swarm Plots,
- Task 8: Observing all Pairwise Correlations.
