# Predicting-House-Prices-with-Regression-using-TensorFlow
Predicting House Prices with Regression using TensorFlow


Course Objectives
In this course, I am going to focus on the following learning objectives:

- Learn to create, train and evaluate neural network models with TensorFlow and Keras.
- Learn to solve regression problems with the help of neural networks.


By the end of this course, I was able to create a neural network model which was able to predict price of a house given some input features with a high degree of accuracy.


Project Structure
The project on Predicting House Prices is divided into following tasks:

- Task 1: Introduction
Introduction to the house pricing problem.
Prerequisites for this course.
Introduction to the Rhyme interface.
Importing libraries and helper functions.


- Task 2: The Dataset
Importing the dataset.
A quick look at a few examples.
Check missing data.


- Task 3: Data Normalization
Data normalization.
Convert label values back to prices.


- Task 4: Training and Test Sets
Select features.
Select labels.
Convert from Pandas data structures to numpy arrays.
Train and test split.


- Task 5: Creating the Model
Creating a sequential model with Keras.
Model architecture - hidden layers and hidden units.
Compiling the model by specifying an optimizer and a loss function.
Computing trainable parameters.


- Task 6: Model Training
Training the model to fit to training data.
Plotting training and validation loss.


- Task 7: Predictions
Plot and compare raw predictions.
Plot and compare price predictions.
