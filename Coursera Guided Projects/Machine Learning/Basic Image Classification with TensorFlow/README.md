# Basic-Image-Classification-with-TensorFlow
Basic Image Classification with TensorFlow


Course Objectives
In this course, I am going to focus on three learning objectives:

- Learn to create, train and evaluate neural network models with TensorFlow and Keras.
- Understand the basics of neural networks.
- Learn to solve classification problems with the help of neural networks.


By the end of this course, I was able to create a neural network model which was able to classify images of hand written digits with a high degree of accuracy.


Project Structure
The project on Basic Image Classification is divided into following tasks:

- Task 1: Introduction
Introduction to the basic image classification problem.
What is TensorFlow?



- Task 2: The Dataset
Importing the MNIST dataset.
A quick look at the structure of the dataset.
A quick look at the MNIST image examples.


- Task 3: One Hot Encoding
What is one hot encoding?
How to encode the labels from the dataset.


- Task 4: Neural Networks
Graphical representation of linear equations.
What are neural networks?
What are activation functions?


- Task 5: Pre-processing the Examples
Unrolling the input features.
Data normalization with mean and standard deviation.


- Task 6: Creating the Model
Creating a sequential model with Keras.
Model architecture - hidden layers and hidden units.
Softmax and ReLU activation functions.
Compiling the model by specifying an optimizer and a loss function.


- Task 7: Training the Model
Training the model to fit to training data.
Evaluating the model on the test data.


- Task 8: Predictions
Predictions on the test set.
Visualizing the predictions.
