# Custom-Prediction-Routine-on-Google-AI-Platform
Custom Prediction Routine on Google AI Platform


Course Objectives
In this course, I am going to focus on two learning objectives:

- Deploy a model with custom prediction routine on Google AI Platform.
- Use a model deployed on Google AI Platform for inference.


By the end of this course, I was able to create and deploy a model with custom prediction routines on Google AI Platform.
