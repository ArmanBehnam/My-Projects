# Image Super Resolution Using Autoencoders in Keras

In this project, we design and build an autoencoder neural network to create high-resolution images from low-resolution source images. This has been accomplished by completing the following tasks in the project:

* Task 1: Project Overview and Import Libraries
* Task 2: What are Autoencoders?
* Task 3: Build the Encoder
* Task 4: Build the Decoder to Complete the Network
* Task 5: Create Dataset and Specify Training Routine
* Task 6: Load the Dataset and Pre-trained Model
* Task 7: Model Predictions and Visualizing the Results
