# Classify-Radio-Signals-from-Space-with-Keras
Radio Signals from Space (collected by SETI, Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence Institute) were classified into 4 categories - ["squiggle", "narrowband", "noise", "narrowbanddrd"], using a convolutional neural network. The network was trained on the 2D Spectrogram images of the signals

Look at the notebook file for the code. 

These steps were used to Classify the radio signals - 

1. Import Libraries
2. Load and Preprocess Data
3. Create Training and Validation Data Generators
4. Build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Model
5. Learning Rate Scheduling and Compile the Model
6. Train the Model
7. Evaluate the Mode

The model provided more than 74% accuracy in classifying Radio Signals.

This was a guided project on the Coursera website.
