# Statistical Data Visualization with Seaborn (Guided_Project)
Offered through [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/projects/statistical-data-visualization-seaborn)

This guided project is the second in a series on how to use Seaborn for data visualization. The project uses the [Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data) to go over how to:
* visualize pair-wise correlations in a heatmap
* drop correlated features before classification using XGBoost from sci-kit learn
* check model accuracy with a confusion matrix
* perform recursive feature elimination with cross-validation
* perform principal component analysis

Since this is the second project, work from the first project is also included at the beginning of the notebook.
